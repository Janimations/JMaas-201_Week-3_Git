# JMaas-201_Week-3_Git


###The Purpose of this app is to collect data on how many times a user clicks on an image that is randomly displayed from a pool ###of many (total amount can vary). The app needs to track how many times an image was actually clicked-on and how many times it ###was randomly displayed.
###It then will have to display that data on screen in a chart and in text format.


##User stories:

##Market research team:
###As a market researcher for mushroom-popularity I want a reliable way to collect data on what kind of mushroom my focus group ###likes best.

##Developer:
###As a web-developer I obviously want to write code that works reliably according to the specifications and is easy to read and ###edit.

##Focus group user:
###As a user selected for market research I want to have a UI that is easy to understand and that works reliably.
